# `sp1-sui` - SP1 Verifier on Sui

![SP1 Sui Banner](banner.png)

This crate verifies Groth16 proofs generated by [SP1 zkVM](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) in Sui Move smart contract leveraging the Groth16 Move verifier over BN254.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This repository is not audited for production use.

## Repository Overview

- The `sp1-sui` library is located in the [`verifier`](verifier) directory. 
- The [`examples/move/groth16_verifier`](examples/move/groth16_verifier) directory contains a sample Sui Move smart contract for verifying SP1 proofs.
- The [`examples/sp1-sui-sdk`](examples/sp1-sui-sdk) directory contains a sample example using the Sui Rust SDK for verifying SP1 proofs with PTB (Programmable Transaction Blocks).
- The [`examples/sp1-jwt-verify-email-domain`](examples/sp1-jwt-verify-email-domain) directory contains a fully-fledged example that verifies whether someone has access to a domain name without revealing their identity. You can integrate this today on Sui. Follow the [blog post](https://soundness.xyz/blog/sp1sui) explaining the code.
- The [`proofs`](proofs) directory includes a Fibonacci proof example used in the Sui Groth16 verifier test suite.

## Requirements

- Rust
- Sui Client CLI
  - [Install Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install)

## Acknowledgements

This crate leverages the [`sp1`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) library by Succinct Labs for the gnark-to-ark converter and [`ark-bn254`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra) for working with the BN254 elliptic curve. The repository structure was inspired by the [`sp1-solana`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-solana) verifier.
