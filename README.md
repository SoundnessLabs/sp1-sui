# `sp1-sui`

This crate verifies Groth16 proofs generated by SP1 in Sui Move smart contract leveraging the groth16 Move verifier over BN254.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> This repository is not audited for production use.

## Repository Overview
- The `sp1-sui` library is located in the [`verifier`](verifier) directory. 
- The [`example/groth16_verifier`](example/groth16_verifier) directory contains a sample Sui Move smart contract for verifying SP1 proofs.
- The [`proofs`](proofs) directory includes a Fibonacci proof example used in the Sui Groth16 verifier test suite.

## Requirements
- Rust
- Sui Client CLI
  - [Install Sui](https://docs.sui.io/guides/developer/getting-started/sui-install)

## Acknowledgements

This crate leverages the [`sp1`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1) library by Succinct Labs for the gnark-to-ark converter and [`ark-bn254`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra) for working with the BN254 elliptic curve. The repository structure was inspired by the [`sp1-solana`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/sp1-solana) verifier.
